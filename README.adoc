= Tiny IPC library for PHP

User-friendly, object-oriented API for message passing between PHP processes.

Stream sockets are used as message passing channels. A single server can listen for and handle messages on multiple channels, which can include any mix of Unix domain sockets and TCP/IP (v4 and v6).

Messages are PHP strings. Serialisation format is left to user's choice.
